        <p>
            From the moment i started creating music,
            I dreamed of building my own audio plugin that would fit my exact needs,
            streamline my workflow,
            and allow me to dive deep into the world of audio processing.
            I was fascinated by how mathematics and signal processing can be used
            to shape sound, even though the complexity of thes field was intimidating.

        <h3>
            The Journey
        </h3>
        <p>
            Developing ExoDist was a challenging yet rewarding journey.
            Initially, the biggest hurdle was the choice of programming language:
            C++.
            Althrough it's known for its efficiency and its a go-to for audio plugins,
            I had no prior experience with it.
            After some struggles with tutorials and limited time outside of work,
            I decidedt to make a bold move.
            I asked my trainer for permission to dedicate work hours to this project,
            and he agreed.
            Wit this support, I was able to dive headfirst into learning C++,
            the JUCE framework, and the fundamentals of Digital Signal Progessing (DSP). 
        </p>

        <h3>
            Development Process
        </h3>
        <p>
            I kicked off the project usint the <b>IPERKA method</b>,
            a structured approach taught in Swiss IT schools.
            This helped me outline my vision, set clear goals, 
            and start coding with a solid plan.
            As i delved deeper into the project,
            it quickly became apparent that this was no small task - 
            it would take several months to complete.
            Despite the challanges, I've made significant progress and
            am now in the final stages of development, 
            with most of the DSP work complete.
            The UI is the next major milestone before release.

            What's Next?
        </h3>

        <p>
        ExoDist is still a work in progress, 
        but the end is in sight. 
        The source code is available as an open project, 
        while compiled binaries will be available for purchase upon release. 
        This project has not only taught me about the technical 
        side of audio plugin development 
        but has also shown me how deeply rewarding it is 
        to create a tool that bridges my love for coding and music production.
